## üé® Customization

You can easily customize these forms:

* **Add New Themes:**
    1.  In `index.html`, duplicate an existing `<div class="form-container ...">` block.
    2.  Assign a new unique class name (e.g., `custom-theme-mode`).
    3.  In `style.css`, create a new CSS block for `.custom-theme-mode` and define your desired colors, gradients, and other styles.
* **Change Colors:** Modify the `background`, `color`, `input` styles, and `button` gradients within the specific theme classes in `style.css`.
* **Adjust Scrolling:** Open `index.html` and locate the `<script>` tag at the very end of the `<body>`.
    * Change `scrollAmount` to control how many pixels are scrolled per step (smaller value = finer scroll).
    * Change `scrollIntervalTime` to control the delay between each scroll step (larger value = slower scroll).
